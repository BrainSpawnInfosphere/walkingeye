# Python Robot Controller

This is the second version of my soccer robot.

* Doesn't use [ROS](http://ros.org), ROS is a pain to install and maintain on OSX and various linux systems
	* Uses some of the same ideas, but not RPC-XML
* Uses [Zero MQ](http://http://zeromq.org/) instead of `roscore`
* Uses my PS4 controller with PySDL2
* Uses [wit.ai](http://wit.ai) for speech-to-text
* Uses OpenCV to process on-board or stream video off-board to remote
* All of this runs on [Raspberry Pi B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org)

**Note:** This re-write is still very early and not fully running yet, just parts.
