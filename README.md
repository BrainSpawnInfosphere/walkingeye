This is my second one after the RC version, which didn't work as nicely as I
wanted it too.

Between the mat with a grid in inches and my cat, you can get an idea of the size.

The 2 buck converts (5V and 7.5V) were really close to each other, so I stuck a piece of cardboard between them. To prevent the cardboard from slipping, I also used some tape to hold them in place. I will eventaully turn this into a real PCB once I am fully happy with it and do a better layout.

Decent job of soldering and wire wrapping, however, the scrap of protoboard I was useing only had 1 mounting hole to put a nylon stand off in. So far the single mount point doesn't seem to be an issue.

My hand drawn circuit diagrams using some protoboard pictures I found on the internet. I will eventually turn these into PCB's and post the schematics (probably going to use EagleCAD since it is free).
