# Bill of Materials

### Raspberry Pi

I am currently using a 1.2 GHz quad core [RPi 3](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3055)
(ARMv8) as the main board running the lite version of Raspbian. It has on-board:

* 802.11n Wifi
* Bluetooth 4.1 BLE

However, I have done a little testing and it looks like the Pi Zero **might** be
powerful enough to do the job too. When I get more time, I will investigate it
more.

### Pi Camera

[PiCamera](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3099) is used to stream images.

### 3D Models

The 3d printer models (stl format) come from the following sources:

* [Legs](https://github.com/mogillc/nico) which are the coxa, femur, and tibia
* Misc brackets I made using [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/)

### Cost

Here is a parts list of **key components** that I am using. I am not listing
wires, bread boards, cables, etc. Also note, I have rounded up the costs
(i.e., $4.95 => $5). Also, lot of the body is 3d printed, the costs for that are
not shown here.
