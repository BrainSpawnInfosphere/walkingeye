GITS

"I think I'm starting to understand it now. Maybe, just maybe, it's a concept that's 
similar to a zero in mathematics. In other words, it's a symbol that denies the absence 
of meaning, the meaning that's necessitated by the delineation of one system from another. 
In analog, that's God. In digital, it's zero. ...So, for the time being, no matter how 
much data we accumulate, we'll never have a Ghost. But analog-based people like you, 
Batou-san, no matter how many digital components you add through cyberization or prosthetics, 
your Ghost will never be damaged. Plus, you can even die, cause you've got a Ghost. You're 
so lucky."
